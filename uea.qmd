### Developing tools to measure, monitor and predict temporal and spatial changes in soundscape complexity, and the mental health and well-being benefits conferred, at multiple spatial scales.
<hr />

In this project theme, we will combine the BTOâ€™s [Breeding Bird Survey (BBS)](https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/breeding-bird-survey) and [Atlas](https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/birdatlas) data with sound files from [Xeno-Canto](https://xeno-canto.org/) to reconstruct and to map habitat-specific natural soundscapes across the UK.

We will relate the acoustic properties of these soundscapes to local habitat and landscape characteristics to determine key drivers of spatial and temporal dynamics in soundscape complexity.

Working with the outputs from the [Psychology](surrey.qmd) and [Economics](gla.qmd) project themes, we will develop tools for measuring, monitoring and predicting mental health and well-being value based on natural soundscape characteristics.

We will also up-scale measures of local soundscape complexity to build a national indicator of natural soundscape stocks.

*The ecology project theme is based at the University of East Anglia, led by [Professor Simon Butler](researchstaff.qmd#sec-eco) and investigated by [Dr Claire Buchan](researchstaff.qmd#sec-eco).*
